			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Is there a relationship between proximity to Boston and a higher percentage of single family homes?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I started thinking about this question because of one of the arguments used by many metro Boston municipalities 
						to slow down desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement was to reduce the influx of residents from Boston 
						to their more "relaxed" suburbs by restricting the multi-family housing available. As such, even though all 
						of the municipalities we are analyzing are still somewhat close to Boston, I started wondering if the distance 
						to Boston affected the percentage of land zoned in that municipality for single-family housing.</li>
					<li>I also began thinking about the class zoning that intentionally or unintentionally arises as a result of 
						increasing the amount of single family homes (since with the rising housing prices in the area, it has 
						become more unfeasible for working-class adults and families to live in a single-family home). 
						Through this train of thought and with the availability of some MBTA-related data in the Zoning dataset, 
						I began to wonder if a municipality's accessability to MBTA transportation affected the percentage of 
						lower family homes, since someone able to afford a single-family home would be able to afford a car and 
						need to rely less on public transportation.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of single family homes being constructed in the municipality affect the percentage of minority residents?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>and vice versa?</li>
					<li>How does the percentage of Black residents affect the percentage of single family homes constructed?</li>
					<li>How does the percentage of Black and Hispanic residents affect the percentage of single family homes constructed?</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of non-single-family homes available in a municipality lend itself to housing residents of differing income levels?</li>
