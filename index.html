			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Is there a relationship between proximity to Boston and a higher percentage of single family homes?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I started thinking about this question because of one of the arguments used by many metro Boston municipalities 
						to slow down desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement was to reduce the influx of residents from Boston 
						to their more "relaxed" suburbs by restricting the multi-family housing available. As such, even though all 
						of the municipalities we are analyzing are still somewhat close to Boston, I started wondering if the distance 
						to Boston affected the percentage of land zoned in that municipality for single-family housing.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of single family homes being constructed in the municipality affect the percentage of minority residents?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>In a similar vein to my rationale for the previous question, I wondered if the racial motivations for increasing 
						the amount of reserved land for single-family homes in the 60s extended to present day and whether those motivations
						 remained confined to Black residents or extended to all minorities.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of reserved single-family homes in a municipality affect the income distribution of its residents?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I expected this to be more of a "control" answer, since single-family homes are normally far more expensive than 
						multi-family homes, and hence less affordable for lower-income residents. Hence, I expected to see a negative 
						correlation between the percentage of land reserved for single-family housing and the percentage of lower-income 
						households residing in the municipality. I hoped to use the results of this question's corresponding visualizations
						to inform how statistically significant the other results are.</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				The figure above visualizes the Boston metro area and the percentage of space designated for single-family homes 
				in each municipality in the area. The darker the municipality is colored, the more space is reserved. We can see 
				that the most of the furthest areas from Boston (the one labeled municipality on the map) are the lightest color, 
				however, the closest areas are the same lightest color. From the legend, we can see that this lightest color 
				corresponds to a reservation percentage range of 0-5%. Indeed, after studying the raw data, we realize that many 
				of these municipalities do not have data on the reservation of single-family homes, so it is difficult to get a 
				full picture of its relationship with the distance of the municipality from Boston. As a result, I decided to 
				create a filter to remove the cities without any data to get a better idea of the results.

					Before discussing the figure, I want to note an important assumption that I made--I considered 0.00% of land 
					reserved to single-family housing to be equivalent to a lack of data, particularly after making the other 
					visualizations and noticing the incompleteness of the dataset. Adding the 0.00% data points paints a different 
					picture, as we see in the previous figure, but once we remove the municipalities with no data (of which Boston is one), 
					we notice that the municipalities closest to Boston reserve a large amount of land for single-family homes, but not 
					as much as those slightly further. Finally, the furthest areas from Boston downtown tend to have the least amount 
					of land reserved for single-family housing. I thought that this unusual finding corroborated with Amy Dain's analysis 
					of zoning's use as a tool of race and class exclusion in the mid-century. People migrating from the Boston municipality 
					generally looked to surrounding areas. The reports of the municipalities that were a little further from Boston downtown
					indicated a desire to preserve a quieter, more sparse ambience and cared less about the fiscal advantages of building 
					multi-family homes. The figure suggests that those trends persist 75 years later.

					I also began thinking about the class zoning that intentionally or unintentionally arises as a result of 
					increasing the amount of single family homes (since with the rising housing prices in the area, it has 
					become more unfeasible for working-class adults and families to live in a single-family home). 
					Through this train of thought and with the availability of some MBTA-related data in the Zoning dataset, 
					I began to wonder if a municipality's accessability to MBTA transportation affected the percentage of 
					lower family homes, since someone able to afford a single-family home would be able to afford a car and 
					need to rely less on public transportation. However, as the figure indicates, only two of the Boston metro
					municipalities appear to have MBTA access (and/or the census data is incomplete, which is the more likely
					theory because of the well-connectedness of the T in the areas surrounding Boston). Boston is also indicated
					as having MBTA access per the raw data but is excluded from this map because of its lack of data regarding
					the percentage of land designated for single-family housing. With the general lack of data, I do not think
					that any meaningful conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of access to the MBTA and the percentage
					of land devoted to single-family housing.

					Once I made the original graph and didn't immediately see any trends, I started wondering about the direction
					of the relationship I was asking about. Did the percentage of land being zoned to single family homes affect
					the number of Black people living in the municipality or vice versa? The reversed axes form the relation
					suggested by the zoning policies in the 60s, but perhaps that relation also exists in present day. While the
					data remains exactly the same between the two visualizations, I wanted to include the latter in this report to 
					challenge my initial notion of the percentage of single-family homes <it>causing</it> a reduced relative Black 
					population by altering the axes to reflect the traditional perception of the x-axis as the "independent" 
					variable and the y-axis as the "dependent" variable.
