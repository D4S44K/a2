			<h2>Subtheme: Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Is there a relationship between proximity to Boston and a higher percentage of single family homes?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I started thinking about this question because of one of the arguments used by many metro Boston municipalities 
						to slow down desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement was to reduce the influx of residents from Boston 
						to their more "relaxed" suburbs by restricting the multi-family housing available. As such, even though all 
						of the municipalities we are analyzing are still somewhat close to Boston, I started wondering if the distance 
						to Boston affected the percentage of land zoned in that municipality for single-family housing.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of single family homes being constructed in the municipality affect the percentage of minority residents?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>In a similar vein to my rationale for the previous question, I wondered if the racial motivations for increasing 
						the amount of reserved land for single-family homes in the 60s extended to present day and whether those motivations
						 remained confined to Black residents or extended to all minorities.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of reserved single-family homes in a municipality affect the income distribution of its residents?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I expected this to be more of a "control" answer, since single-family homes are normally far more expensive than 
						multi-family homes, and hence less affordable for lower-income residents. Hence, I expected to see a negative 
						correlation between the percentage of land reserved for single-family housing and the percentage of lower-income 
						households residing in the municipality. Of course, this ignores the presence of low-income affordable housing,
						but given that there are not many such units (as discussed in previous weeks), I figured that there would not be
						too much of an impact on the data. I hoped to use the results of this question's corresponding visualizations
						to inform how statistically significant the other results are.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				The figure above visualizes the Boston metro area and the percentage of space designated for single-family homes 
				in each municipality in the area. The darker the municipality is colored, the more space is reserved. We can see 
				that the most of the furthest areas from Boston (the one labeled municipality on the map) are the lightest color, 
				however, the closest areas are the same lightest color. From the legend, we can see that this lightest color 
				corresponds to a reservation percentage range of 0-5%. Indeed, after studying the raw data, we realize that many 
				of these municipalities do not have data on the reservation of single-family homes, so it is difficult to get a 
				full picture of its relationship with the distance of the municipality from Boston. As a result, I decided to 
				create a filter to remove the cities without any data to get a better idea of the results.

				<figcaption>
					Before discussing the figure, I want to note an important assumption that I made--I considered 0.00% of land 
					reserved to single-family housing to be equivalent to a lack of data, particularly after making the other 
					visualizations and noticing the incompleteness of the dataset. Adding the 0.00% data points paints a different 
					picture, as we see in the previous figure, but once we remove the municipalities with no data (of which Boston is one), 
					we notice that the municipalities closest to Boston reserve a large amount of land for single-family homes, but not 
					as much as those slightly further. Finally, the furthest areas from Boston downtown tend to have the least amount 
					of land reserved for single-family housing. I thought that this unusual finding corroborated with Amy Dain's analysis 
					of zoning's use as a tool of race and class exclusion in the mid-century. People migrating from the Boston municipality 
					generally looked to surrounding areas. The reports of the municipalities that were a little further from Boston downtown
					indicated a desire to preserve a quieter, more sparse ambience and cared less about the fiscal advantages of building 
					multi-family homes. The figure suggests that those trends persist 75 years later.

				<figcaption>
					I also began thinking about the class zoning that intentionally or unintentionally arises as a result of 
					increasing the amount of single family homes (since with the rising housing prices in the area, it has 
					become more unfeasible for working-class adults and families to live in a single-family home). 
					Through this train of thought and with the availability of some MBTA-related data in the Zoning dataset, 
					I began to wonder if a municipality's accessability to MBTA transportation affected the percentage of 
					lower family homes, since someone able to afford a single-family home would be able to afford a car and 
					need to rely less on public transportation. However, as the figure indicates, only two of the Boston metro
					municipalities appear to have MBTA access (and/or the census data is incomplete, which is the more likely
					theory because of the well-connectedness of the T in the areas surrounding Boston). Boston is also indicated
					as having MBTA access per the raw data but is excluded from this map because of its lack of data regarding
					the percentage of land designated for single-family housing. With the general lack of data, I do not think
					that any meaningful conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of access to the MBTA and the percentage
					of land devoted to single-family housing.

				This is the first of the visualizations aiming to answer my second question. While I eventually settled on analyzing
				the impact of reserving more single-family housing on minority populations, my first thought after watching Dain's video
				had been about the impact on Black residents because of the second wave of zoning exclusions at the height of the Civil
				Rights movement. Afterward, I felt that analyzing different population groups would would help form a more conclusive
				answer to my initial question. I would also like to note that there were two outliers in the dataset with a disproportionately
				higher percentage of Black residents (Randolph with 44.8549% and Stoughton with 15.6475%) which caused the reduced the
				granularity of the remaining data. As a result, I chose to exclude them from the plot, however, Randolph had 97.7813% of its
				land reserved for single-family housing and Stoughton had 43.8257%, compared to the metro-wide average of 55.3768%. At first,
				the data appeared to reveal no apparent correlation, but adding a line of best fit indicated a slight positive correlation
				between the percentage of land reserved for single-families in a municipality and their Black population (R^2 = 0.0057).

					Once I made the original graph and didn't immediately see any trends, I started wondering about the direction
					of the relationship I was asking about. Did the percentage of land being zoned to single family homes affect
					the number of Black people living in the municipality or vice versa? The reversed axes form the relation
					suggested by the zoning policies in the 60s, but perhaps that relation also exists in present day. While the
					data remains exactly the same between the two visualizations, I wanted to include the latter in this report to 
					challenge my initial notion of the percentage of single-family homes <it>causing</it> a reduced relative Black 
					population by altering the axes to reflect the traditional perception of the x-axis as the "independent" 
					variable and the y-axis as the "dependent" variable.

				<img src="white.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Since I was viewing zoning through the lens of race, it made sense to repeat my previous process but with White 
					residents. In this case, there appeared to be limited correlation between the percentage of White people living 
					in Boston metro municipalities and the percentage of land zoned to single-family housing. In fact, the R^2 value 
					with linear regression was merely 0.0004%. While the polynomial of best fit (cubic) had a higher R^2 value (0.1058), 
					it appeared to overfit the data, in finding a minima (since the municipalities with around 50% White residents have 
					varying percentages of land zoned for single-family housing). A possible reason for this is the relatively large
					(and uniform) percentage of White residents in the Boston metro area (we can see that the scatter plot might have
					two nearly horizontal lines of best fit, one through the high 90% and one through the 50s).

				<figcaption>
				Since people who identify as Hispanic or Latino have historically experienced significant discrimination in the United
				States, I was curious to see how the corresponding graph would compare to those of Black and White residents in the
				Boston metro area. The Hispanic population percentage appeared to be slightly larger than the Black population percentage
				(This is also evident, since the slope of the line of best fit is steeper) and a higher R^2 value (0.0163), though once
				again, this value may be too small to pinpoint a correlation.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="minorities.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Finally, this figure attempts to show the effect of reserving single-family housing on minority population in the
				Boston metro area. In this case, I defined "minority" as any non-White population (which is a little tricky, since
				I included multiracial residents, but since that population is one of the smallest discussed here, the results are
				hopefully still relevant). The line of best fit pictured is the steepest of the other groups discussed, suggesting
				that there is a larger increase in percentage of minority population with an increase in percentage of land zoned for
				single-family housing. However, the R^2 value, in a similar vein to the others, is merely 0.0728, though this number is
				the highest of the four, perhaps suggesting that combining all minority groups reduces outliers.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="income.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				According to the Boston Globe (one of the readings from A1), the median salary in Boston is around $86,000 and a Google search
				highlights that the average household income is around $95,000. Because the data set provided income data in increments of $100,000, I
				decided to use the less than 100,000 category to denote the "low-income" households in Boston (though of course, $100,000 is
				quite different from $86,000). The data suggested a slight negative correlation between the percentage of lower-income households
				and the percentage of land zoned to single-family housing, though the correlation (R^2) is lower than I had expected (0.0492), less
				than the correlation between the minority population and single-family housing land, leading me to believe that there are additional
				factors that I had not considered when originally creating my hypothesis.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>I enjoyed learning about and exploring the impact of single-family zoning (a topic I did not know much about before this assignment) 
				on various populations. My biggest takeaway (besides Tableau having a steep learning curve) is that the quality of your
				visualizations and results will only be as good as the completeness of your dataset. I used a combination of the two datasets
				provided for the zoning subtheme, and both had incomplete columns and/or data that lacked granularity, because of which, my 
				results did not have the confidence that I expected them to have.

				I also found myself making many assumptions and taking several creative liberties (articulated throughout the captions) 
				that underscored our discussion during reading group regarding the influence of the author's perspective and the 
				subjectiveness of visualizations on the whole. Perhaps including certain data points or using different trend lines
				could have altered my results and how they are perceived.

				Finally, I realized that I still do not have a complete understanding of the issues surrounding zoning--in light of the results,
				my initial questions appeared too simplistic, but I am excited to keep learning more about this subtheme and others to form 
				a more nuanced perspective.
