			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Is there a relationship between proximity to Boston and a higher percentage of single family homes?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I started thinking about this question because of one of the arguments used by many metro Boston municipalities 
						to slow down desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement was to reduce the influx of residents from Boston 
						to their more "relaxed" suburbs by restricting the multi-family housing available. As such, even though all 
						of the municipalities we are analyzing are still somewhat close to Boston, I started wondering if the distance 
						to Boston affected the percentage of land zoned in that municipality for single-family housing.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of single family homes being constructed in the municipality affect the percentage of minority residents?</li>
				<ul>
					<li>In a similar vein to my rationale for the previous question, I wondered if the racial motivations for increasing 
						the amount of reserved land for single-family homes in the 60s extended to present day and whether those motivations
						 remained confined to Black residents or extended to all minorities.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>How does the percentage of non-single-family homes available in a municipality lend itself to housing lower-income residents?</li>

					I also began thinking about the class zoning that intentionally or unintentionally arises as a result of 
					increasing the amount of single family homes (since with the rising housing prices in the area, it has 
					become more unfeasible for working-class adults and families to live in a single-family home). 
					Through this train of thought and with the availability of some MBTA-related data in the Zoning dataset, 
					I began to wonder if a municipality's accessability to MBTA transportation affected the percentage of 
					lower family homes, since someone able to afford a single-family home would be able to afford a car and 
					need to rely less on public transportation.

					Once I made the original graph and didn't immediately see any trends, I started wondering about the direction
					of the relationship I was asking about. Did the percentage of land being zoned to single family homes affect
					the number of Black people living in the municipality or vice versa? The reversed axes form the relation
					suggested by the zoning policies in the 60s, but perhaps that relation also exists in present day.
